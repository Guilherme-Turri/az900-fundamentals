## About
Study case for AZ-900 certification.

 ## 🔸 Primary types of cloud:

### `Public`
- No capital expenses for vertical scaling.
- An app can be provisioned and deprovisioned quickly.
- The organization only pays for what it uses.

### `Private`
- Initial hardware must be acquired for setup and maintenance.
- The organization has full control over resources and security.
- The organization is responsible for all scales, such as security, architecture, authentication, and maintenance.

### `Hybrid`
- Offers greater flexibility
- Organization determines where to run its applications, e.g., Public cloud for security, private for hardware.

## 🔸 Cloud benefits:
### `High availability`
- SLA (Service Level Agreement) High availability time.

### `Scalability`
- vertical (up) vs. horizontal(out ) (energy x clusters).
### Vertical:
  - Also known as "scaling up."
  - Involves increasing the capacity of a single resource, such as adding more processing power, memory, or storage to a server.
  - Often occurs within a virtual machine or dedicated server.
  - It's more suitable for workloads that require higher resource capacity, but it can have physical limits and be more expensive compared to horizontal scalability.

### Horizontal:
  - Also known as "scaling out."
  - Involves adding more identical instances of a resource, such as virtual machines or servers, to distribute the load.
  - Can be done more efficiently and elastically in terms of resources as more instances are added according to demand.
  - It's highly suitable for scenarios where demand varies and maintaining consistent performance is crucial, potentially being more cost-effective as you only pay for what you use.
###  `Elasticity`
- Ability to increase power, for example during holidays when demand for a service will be higher.

### `Global reach`
- Providing a server for multiple countries.

### `Customer latency capability`
  - Ability to measure and improve latency.

### `Considerations about predictive cost`
- If a standard is maintained, it's easy to predict expenses/costs.

### `Disaster recovery`
- Swift movement in case of any issue (disaster), with the global reach help.

### `Security`
- Effective and certified security policy.

### `Failure Tolerance`
- Low failure rate

## 🔸CAPEX x OPEX:
### `Capex`
- Company expenditure (such as infrastructure, etc.) all at once.

### `Capex`
- Spending as needed
- Spending in installments
 ### Consumption-based mode
 - You spend -> You pay.
 - Not spent -> Not paid.
 - Better cost prediction. Billing based on actual usage.
